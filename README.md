# Peronal-Project-Flappy_Bird_Clone

This was one of the first things I made, before I became a computer science student and before I really knew how to program.

It was developed using GameMakerStudio 1, in the language made for the software called GML (or Game Maker Language). It, like GDScript, is
a loosely-typed language and does not require semi-colons or variable-type declaration.

The reason for including this is to demonstrate that I had an interest and desire to learn programming even before I became a student at 
NDSU. I found it to be a very fun and creative way to make neat things and solve problems like puzzles. I followed tutorials to build the 
basics of this game, but then towards the end I started adding more things like the ability to save high scores to your computer and the 
game remembering that. I also added sound effects, music, and some intro screens like an actual game. My goal was to make this a complete
game experience using tutorials and guides to help me accomplish that.

Notes: 
- As this being a completely new venture to me, there are some problems with the game. The most notable is the performance issues. This  
  was before I understood how to manage my in-game objects. 

- With GameMakerStudio, I was able to export this game into different types based on the libraries I had access to. I did end up creating 
  a windows installer that allowed me to actually install the game and play it like it was it's own piece of software.
  
- Now that I have learned more, this is another project I would like to revisit in the future at some point to see how much I could       
  improve upon it and make it run better and even add more features.
